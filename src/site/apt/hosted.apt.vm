Configuring the Hosted mode server

  Another aspect of gwt-maven-plugin to be familiar with it can help you configure the
  embedded Servlet container GWT uses in the Hosted Mode shell. The standard
  <<src/main/webapp>> webapp folder is used by gwt-maven-plugin to run the hosted mode
  server (Jetty).

* Using Eclipse

  Google Eclipse plugin automatically handle launching the Hosted mode browser with a
  simple right click on your module <<gwt.xml>> file "run as > web application".

* Using command line

  You can use <<<mvn gwt:run>>> to launch the hosted mode from command line. In such case,
  the plugin will compile your classes and prepare the exploded webapp structure. The hosted
  mode is then launched on your webapp.
