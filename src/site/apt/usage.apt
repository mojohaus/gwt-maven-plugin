Configuring Google Web Toolkit support for maven

* Compile GWT application into JavaScript

  You can use the following configuration in your pom.xml to run the GWT compiler
  when the project is built. By default, the {{{compile-mojo.html}compile}} goal is configured
  to be executed during the ''compile'' phase.

+---+
<project>
  [...]
  <build>
    <plugins>
      [...]
      <plugin>
        <groupId>org.codehaus.mojo</groupId>
        <artifactId>gwt-maven-plugin</artifactId>
        <version>1.1</version>
        <executions>
          <execution>
            <configuration>
              <module>com.mycompany.gwt.Module</module>
            </configuration>
            <goals>
              <goal>compile</goal>
            </goals>
          </execution>
        </executions>
      </plugin>
      [...]
    </plugins>
  </build>
  [...]
</project>

  You can also configure compilation for multiple modules by nesting them inside a ''<modules>'' element. If none is
  set, the plugin will scan project source and resources directories for ''.gwt.xml'' module files.

  See {{{examples/compile.html}examples}} for more details.

* Generate Async interface for GWT-RPC services

  The {{{generateAsync-mojo.html}generateAsync}} goal will create a generate-sources folder and Async interface for all
  RemoteInterface found in the project. To avoid a full scan, only Java source files that matches a
  pattern (defaults to ''**/*Service.java'') are checked.

  See {{{examples/asyn.html}examples}} for more details.

            <configuration>

        </executions>
      </plugin>
      [...]

  </build>
  [...]
</project>

* Generate Message / Consants interface for GWT internationalization

  The {{{i18n-mojo.html}i18n}} goal will create a generate-sources folder and Message (or Constants) interface for the
  ResourceBundles specified in configuration. You can specify the "constantsWithLookup" or "message" parameters to
  choose the interface hierarchy (Message or Constants) to use, "Message" beeing used by default.

  See {{{examples/i18n.html}examples}} for more details.

              <goal>i18n</goal>
            </goals>
            <configuration>
              <resourceBundle>com.mycompany.MyApp</resourceBundle>
              <message>true</message>
            </configuration>
          </execution>
        </executions>
      </plugin>
      [...]
    </plugins>
  </build>
  [...]
</project>

* Setup hosted mode browser

  The {{{eclipse-mojo.html}eclipse}} goal can be used to create an eclipse launch configuration for executing the GWT
  module in hosted browser mode. The required native libraries are also downloaded and installed in
  the user local repository. This goal is not intended to be part of a build phase, but to be executed from
  command line <<<mvn gwt:eclipse>>>.

  See {{{examples/eclipse.html}examples}} for more details.


* Setup GWTTestCase to run in Eclipse

  The {{{eclipseTest-mojo.html}eclipseTest}} goal can be used to create an eclipse launch configuration for executing
  the GWTTestCase-based unit tests. The required native libraries are also downloaded and installed in
  the user local repository. Simply run <<<mvn gwt:eclipseTest>>>

  To avoid conflicts with unit tests, we recommand to follow the naming convention to prefix
  your GWT tests with ''GwtTest''


* Run GWTTestCase & GWTTestSuite inside maven

  GWTTestCase requires some complex setup that makes them difficult to run in maven with the
  surefire plugin. Such tests also are long and start the whole GWT module, so they are not
  ''unit'' but ''integration'' tests.

  The {{{test-mojo.html}test}} goal can be used to run GWTTestCase during the intergation-test
  phase. It will fork a process with the required arguments to run the test, and will report
  on the console the result. It will also create the standard surefire-reports to be used
  by project site reporting.

  This plugin declaration could be part of a profile, so that it gets only enabled on
  continuous integration server, as such test execution is long and will penalize the developper.

  See {{{testing.html}Testing}} for a detailled description of testing with GWT and Maven, and
  suggestion about using GwtTestSuite.
