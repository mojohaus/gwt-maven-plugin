Frequently Asked Questions

* Do I need GWT SDK on my computer to use the plugin ?

  No. The plugin uses maven dependency management to get the required libraries and native components depending on
  your operating system

* How to set the version of GWT to compile my project ?

  gwt-maven-plugin is tied to a version of GWT SDK. gwt-maven-plugin must match the GWT DSK version.
  To use Maven with GWT release prior to GWT 2.1, use gwt-maven-plugin 1.2 and read the documentation. 

* Is there any official Google support for maven ?

  GWT guys don't use Maven by themselves but are interested by our work to provide community support. They helped us to make
  the plugin work with the GWT SDK release candidates.

* I get strange NoSuchMethodError running my application unit tests !

  <<<gwt-dev>>> JAR includes many libraries, including some Apache commons-*. You may use such libs
  in your project with other recent version. Don't define <<<gwt-dev>>> as a dependency, the plugin will resolve it when
  necessary for you based on your <<<gwt-user>>> version.

  Some user report same errors as <<<gwt-dev>>> also include and Eclipse JDT compiler. A way to detect this issue is to
  run mvn dependency:tree and look for any org.eclipse.jdt artifacts listed (GWT's is in the gwt-dev jar added by the
  <<<gwt:compile>>> task itself) - then exclude it from whichever artifact is bringing it in.
