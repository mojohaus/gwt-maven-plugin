Using the Archetype

 Using the archetype is the simpliest way to get a clean, ready for development
 GWT application. It is comparable to the application created by SDK webAppCreator
 with the ''-maven'' option, with some tweaks to nicelly integrate with Google
 Eclipse and M2Eclipse plugins.

* Using the Archetype

 Use it as you would any other Maven archetype to create a template/stub project.
 
+--
 mvn archetype:generate \
   -DarchetypeGroupId=org.codehaus.mojo \
   -DarchetypeArtifactId=gwt-maven-plugin \
   -DarchetypeVersion=${project.version}
+--

  The generated project can then be imported as "existing project" into Eclipse,
  or if you don't like Eclipse you can use another IDE and run command-line maven
  to launch GWT hoste mode with ''mvn gwt:run''.

  Note: don't run mvn <<<archetype:create>>> as the plugin uses archetype 2.0 descriptor.

* Layout

  The generated project layout looks like following figure :

  It uses M2Eclipse for classpath management and Google Eclipse Plugin for nice GWT
  support inside Eclipse.
