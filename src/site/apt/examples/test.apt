  GWT-maven-plugin can execute integration tests that use the GWTTestCase framework. Such tests
  require a complex setup (with a headless hosted mode browser) that is not recommended for
  unit testing. The test Mojo can be used to execute such tests during the integration-test phase.

  To distinct such tests from unit tests, we recommend to use the following naming conventions :
  GWT integration tests are follow the pattern ''*GwtTest.java''. You can the easily configure the
  surefire plugin to exclude them from the test phase :
  
+---+
      <plugin>
        <artifactId>maven-surefire-plugin</artifactId>
        <configuration>
          <excludes>
            <exclude>**/*GwtTest.java</exclude>
          </excludes>
        </configuration>
      </plugin>
+---+  
  
  If you have your own naming convention, the ''test'' Mojo has standard includes/excludes parameter you can set.
  
  A standard surefire report will be generated for each test execution so that you can use the standard maven reporting
  plugins to build the project documentation site or integration with a CI server.
  
  Running GWTTestCase require to fork a new JVM, so the main build has to wait tests to complete. The ''timeOut'' parameter
  can be used if your testcase require very long processing.
  
  The test Mojo also support the (not recommended but usefull) ''-Dmaven.test.skip=true'' option if you want to skip tests,
  and the shortcut ''-DskipTests=true''.
