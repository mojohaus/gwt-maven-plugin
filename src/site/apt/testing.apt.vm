Testing GWT code with Maven

  One special aspect of gwt-maven-plugin to be familiar with is that it runs its own special <<<test>>> goal
  during the "test" phase in order to support <<<GWTTestCase>>> and <<<GWTTestSuite>>> derived GWT tests.

  It's a long story as to why this is needed (having to do with classpath inspection and setup issues
  inside GWTTestCase/JUnitShell), but the regular Maven Surefire testing plugin does not work for
  GWTTestCase tests (at least not with any configuration we have tried, and we have given it a lot of
  efforts).

  Using this special testing support though, requires that you know a few key things, as outlined below:

* Invoking tests

  The gwt-maven-plugin testing support is <<not>> intended to be run standalone, rather it is bound to
  the Maven "<<<integration-test>>>" phase. To get <<<gwt:test>>> to run, you should include the "<<<test>>>"
  goal in your plugin configuration executions, and you should invoke <<<mvn integration-test>>> (or <<<mvn install>>>).

* Separate GwtTest tests from standard unit tests

  Because you will likely want to run <<both>> Surefire and gwt-maven-plugin based tests
  (for regular server side JUnit tests with Surefire, and for client model and controller tests with GWT)
  you need to distinguish these tests from each other. This is done using a naming convention.

  You can configure the Surefire plugin (responsible for running
  tests during maven build) to skip the GwtTests using some naming patterns :

+--
      <plugin>
        <artifactId>maven-surefire-plugin</artifactId>
        <version>2.4.3</version>
        <configuration>
          <excludes>
            <exclude>**/*GwtTest.java</exclude>
          </excludes>
        </configuration>
      </plugin>
+--

  A simplier way to separate classic and GWT tests is to name latests <<<GwtTest"Something.java>>> - they
  <start with> <<<"GwtTest">>>. Surefire looks for tests that are named <<<Something"Test".java>>> by default - they
  <end with> <<<"Test">>>.

  By default, the gwt-maven-plugin uses <<<GwtTest*.java>>> as inclusion pattern so that GwtTest will <<not>> match
  the standard Surefire pattern. Using this convention you don't have to change your configuration.

  To configure the plugin to use such a naming convention, set the <<<includes>>> plugin parameter.

+--
        <plugin>
                <groupId>org.codehaus.mojo</groupId>
                <artifactId>gwt-maven-plugin</artifactId>
                <version>1.1</version>
                <configuration>
                  <includes>**/CustomPattern*.java</includes>
                </configuration>
                <executions>
                    <execution>
                        <goals>
                            <goal>test</goal>
                        </goals>
                    </execution>
                </executions>
        </plugin>

* Test results output

  The plugin mimics as far as possible standard Surefire execution and contributes to execution report. If you use
  the surefire-report-plugin, you will see the GwtTests result included in generated project site.

* About GwtTestSuite

  The {{{http://code.google.com/p/google-web-toolkit-doc-1-5/wiki/DevGuideJUnitSuites}Official GWT documentation}}
  on TestSuites suggest to grouping your GWT tests in a suite by extending GwtTestSuite. Maven will not be able to
  run such a Suite. The snippet below is what will allow both the Eclipse Junit Runner and Maven to run the test cases.

+----
  public class MyGwtTestSuite extends TestCase /*note this is TestCase and not TestSuite */
  {
      public static Test suite()
      {
          GwtTestSuite suite = new GwtTestSuite( "All Gwt Tests go in here" );
          suite.addTestSuite( GwtTest1.class );
          return suite;
      }
+----

* Use GWTTestSuite padawan

  {{{http://google-web-toolkit.googlecode.com/svn/javadoc/2.1/com/google/gwt/junit/client/GWTTestCase.html}<<<GWTTestCase>>>}}
  derived tests are slow. This is because the JUnitShell has to load the module for each test (create the shell, hook into it, etc).
  {{{http://google-web-toolkit.googlecode.com/svn/javadoc/1.5/com/google/gwt/junit/tools/GWTTestSuite.html}<<<GWTTestSuite>>>}}
  mitigates this by grouping all the tests that are for the same module (those that return the same value for getModuleName) together and running them via the same
  shell instance.

  This is a <<big>> time saver, and <<<GWTTestSuite>>> is easy to use, so using it is a good idea. For this reason, the default value of the
  test inclusion pattern is <<<**/Gwt*Suite.java>>>.

  We recommend to name your test suite <<<GwtTestSuite.java>>> so that the test filter picks it up, but name the actual tests
  with a convention that Surefire will ignore by default - something that does <<not>> start with <<<GwtTest>>>, and does <<not>>
  start <or> end with <<<Test>>>. For example <<<MyClassTestGwt.java>>>. This way, gwt-maven-plugin picks up the <<<Suite>>>, and runs it,
  but does not also run individual tests (and Surefire does not pick it up either)

* Run GWTTestCase during "test" phase

  We do not consider GWTTestCase to be unit test as they require the whole GWT Module to run. For this reason, the <<<test>>> goal is
  bound by default to <<<integration-test>>> phase. But this is only our point of view and you may want to run such test during the
  standard <<<test>>> phase. To do this, you just need to define a dedicated <<<execution>>> and to override the default phase
